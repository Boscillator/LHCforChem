<h3>The CMS Detector</h3>
<p>At the LHC, bunches of protons collide with each other 40 million times per second with speeds close to the speed of light and with unimaginable intensity.  Some of the collision energy may be converted into mass, creating new particles which fly out and are observed in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) particle detector.  These short-lived particles can give clues to the fundamental nature of our universe.  </p>
<p>The CMS is designed to detect a wide range of particles and phenomena produced in high-energy collisions in the LHC. Different layers of detectors measure the different particles, and use this key data to build up a picture of events at the heart of the collision.  CMS data is analyzed by scientists around the world to develop a picture of what happens at the heart of the collision.</p>
<p>happens at the heart of the collision.
Scientists then use this data to search for new phenomena that will help to answer questions such as: What is the Universe really made of and what forces act within it? And what gives everything substance? CMS will also measure the properties of previously discovered particles with unprecedented precision, and be on the lookout for completely new, unpredicted phenomena.
