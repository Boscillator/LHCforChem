The Scientific Method
The first chapter of most chemistry textbooks include instruction on how experimental science is done.  An introductory activity that can be used, that also introduces students to how unseen particles are tracked, is given on the http://www.cpepphysics.org/education/activity-4.pdf Contemporary Physics Education Project site
The activity sheets can be modified or tailored in numerous ways to add instruction on dependent and independent variables, controls, and qualitative and quantitative data.  Students can be asked how the experiment can be modified to test for other properties of the particles.
