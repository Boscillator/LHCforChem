What is the LHC?

If you asked most chemists to draw their conception of the structure of a carbon-12 nucleus, they would most likely draw figures to represent the 6 protons and 6 neutrons.  Particle physicists would take this structure much deeper.  Far deeper.  Nucleons, the protons and neutrons, have internal structure and are composed of quarks.  Quarks are characterized by their masses and charges. However, there are many, many more fundamental particles.  Just like peeling the layers of an onion gets you deeper and deeper into the center, colliding subatomic particles, such as protons, at ultrafast speeds, breaks the particles apart so that scientist can discover what is inside. Scientists do this by using particle accelerators.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's most powerful particle accelerator.  It is a 27 kilometer (16.8 mile) buried an average of 100 meters underground at the French-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.  (Hadrons are subatomic particles made of quarks and held together by the strong force.)  Several thousand billion protons travelling in opposite directions at 99.99% of the speed of light travel around the 27 km ring over 11,000 times a second!  They collide at four points around the LHC.  Located at these points are ultra-sensitive detectors, some as large as five-story office buildings, that record the results of those collisions including the creation of unseen particles predicted by theory.  These detectors are called the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb.
