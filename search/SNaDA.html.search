<h3>Scientific Notation and Dimensional Analysis</h3>
<p>Radiation is a form of energy that travels in the form of waves or particles through some medium or through space.  Some radiation can produce charged particles (ions) in matter.  This is called ionizing radiation and it is emitted from the unstable nuclei of atoms.  Unstable atoms are said to be radioactive.  The amount of radioactivity in a sample is given by the identity of the substance and how many curies of the sample are present.  The greater the number of curies, the greater the amount of radioactivity.  For example, uranium-238 has 0.00015 curies of radioactivity per pound (0.15 millicuries), while cobalt-60 has nearly 518,000 curies per pound. Radioactive sources are used in particle physics in order to test particle detectors on a smaller scale than at an actual accelerator. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Example 1:  A radioactive sample has an activity of 2.6 x 108 Bq. What is this activity in mCi?</p>
$$2.6 \times 10^{8} \times \frac{1 Ci}{3.7 \times 10^{8} Bq} \times \frac{10^{3} mCi}{1 Ci} = 7.0 mCi$$
<p>Example 2: A major source of radioactivity in plant tissue is an isotope of potassium, potassium 40. The dose equivalent of consuming one average size banana is 0.1 uSv.  What is this dose in rems?</p>
$$ 0.1 \mu Sv \times \frac{10^{-6}Sv}{1 \mu Sv} \times \frac{100}{rem} = 10^{-5} rem $$
